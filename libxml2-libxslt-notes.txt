==> libxml2
libxml2 is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

If you need to have libxml2 first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/libxml2/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find libxml2 you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/libxml2/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/libxml2/include"

For pkg-config to find libxml2 you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/libxml2/lib/pkgconfig"

==> libxslt
To allow the nokogiri gem to link against this libxslt run:
  gem install nokogiri -- --with-xslt-dir=/usr/local/opt/libxslt

libxslt is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

If you need to have libxslt first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/libxslt/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find libxslt you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/libxslt/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/libxslt/include"

For pkg-config to find libxslt you may need to set:
  export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/libxslt/lib/pkgconfig"
